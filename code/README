What details did you perserve?

butterfly:
	The procedure keeps well the wings and the big textures.

zebra:
	The procedure keeps well the stripes and textures all over the zebra,
	even its face.

fish:
	The procedure keeps well the stripes, and also the fins, and basic structures
	such as eyes.

What details did you lose?

butterfly:
	The procedure doesn't keep the leaves good, and loses the little details
	on the butterflies wings.

zebra:
	The procedure doesn't keep the grass good, and even blurs it a bit, because
	it is very small.

fish:
	The procedure keeps most things quite good, but loses some of the tiny textures
	of the skin of the fish
